## Key Macroeconomic Variables

### Output and Income

*3 Aspects*:
* Data
* Theory
* Policy

The production of output generates income.

To measure total output in dollars, we add up the values of the many different goods and services produced.

This gives **nominal national income**, which is total national income measured in current dollars.

**Real national income** is national income measured in constant (base-period) dollars. It changes only when quantities change.

One of the most commonly used measures of national income is called *gross domestic product (GDP).*

GDP an be measured in real or nominal terms.

The **business cycle** is fluctuations of real national income around its trend value that follow a more or less wavelike pattern.

The **Potential output (Y*)** is the real GDP that the economy would produce if its productive resources were fully employed. It is also called *potential GDP*.

The **output gap** measures the difference between potential output and actual output.

> Output Gap = Y - Y\*


When Y < Y\* , the output gap is called a **recessionary gap**.

When Y > Y\*, the output gap is called an **inflationary gap**.

### Employment, Unemployment, and the Labour Force

**Employment** is the number of persons 15 years of age or older who have jobs.

**Unemployment** is the number of persons 15 years of age or older who are not employed and are actively searching for a job.

The **labour force** is the number of persons employed plus the number of persons unemployed.

The **unemployment rate** is unemployment expressed as a ratio.

> `n-unemployed / n-labour force * 100`

When the economy is at potential GDP, economists say there is full employment.

Even when the economy is at full employment, some unemployment exists because of natural turnover in the labour market (*frictional unemployment*) and the mismatch between jobs and workers (*structureal unemployment*).

When the real GDP is less than potential GDP, there is *cyclical unemployment*.

When `y = y*`, **Full Employment**. In other words, no `n-unemployed`.

Employment has grown roughly in line with the growth in the labour force.

The data also shows that the short-term fluctuations in the unemployment rate have been substantial.

The unemployment rate has been as low as *3.4%* in 1966 and as high as *12%* during the deep recession of 1982

### Why Does Unemployment Matter?

Some unemployment is desirable, as it reflects the time required workers and firms to **find** each other so that good matches are made. But some unemployment is associated with human hardship, especially for those individuals with skills that are not in high demand by firms.

### Productivity

Productivity is a measure of the amount of output that the economy produces per unit of input.

**Labour productivity** is the level of real GDP divided by the level of unemployment (or total hours worked).

### Inflation and Price Level

The **price level** is the average level of all prices in the economy expressed as an index number.

**Inflation** is a rise in the average level of all prices (the price level).

The **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** is an index of the average prices of goods and services commonly bought by households.

The CPI is based on the price of a typical "consumption basket," relative to the price in some base year:

> See Textbook to learn about **Inflation**

#### Why Inflation Matters

If households and firms fully anticipate inflation over the coming year, they will be able to adjust many nominal prices and wages to maintain their real values.

Unanticipated inflation general leads to more changes in the real value of prices and wages.

### Interest Rates

The interest rate is the price paid per dollar borrowed per perriod of time, expressed either as a proportion (e.g., 0.06) or as a percentage (e.g. 6%)

The **nominal interest rate** is the price paid per dollar borrowed per period of time.

The **real interest rate** is the nominal rate of interest adjusted for the change in the purchasing power of money. It is equal to the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation.

Inflation over the past five decades has meant that *the real interest rate has always been less than the nominal interest rate.*

#### The International Economy

In June 2015 you could buy 0.72 euros for each dollar that you gave up. Or you could buy 1 euro for 1.38 dollars.

The **exchange rate** is the number of units of domestic currency required to purchase one unit of foreign currency.

**Foreign currency** refers to foreign currencies or claims on foreign currencies, such as bank deposits, cheques, and promissory notes, that are payable in foreign money.

A rise in the exchange rate means that it takes more Canadian dollars to purchase one unit of foreign currency - this is a **depreciation**  of the Canadian dollar.

# Security

* When doing web dev, you can **never** ignore Security
  * Your system is inherently attackable
  * 99% secure is failure

## Basics: Input & Output

* Basic idea: can't trust any input, and must carefully control your output.
* assume all input is dangerous
  * assume every piece of input is broken/missing/malformed/malicious/stupid ... *until proven otherwise*
* e.g. dropdown select in HTML.
```html
  <select name="foo">
    <option value="1">One</option>
    <option value="2">Two</option>
  </select>
```
  * I expect `foo == "1"` or `foo == "2"`
  * *but it's easy to send a request with `foo=="3"`*
  * or 100kB of garbage
* make sure you check everything
  * is it even there?
  * is it in the format you expected?
  * is it a legal value?
  * is it coming from the user you expect?
* for output, escape accordingly
  * what special characters must be escaped?
  * e.g. in HTML, `<` -> `&lt;`
  * look for a library function to escape correctly.

## SQL Injection

* general cause: building SQL queries from user input.
* e.g. your code does something like:
```javascript
id = request['id']
query = "SELECT * FROM items WHERE id = " + id
```
* but input might be:
```sql
0; DROP TABLE items 0 or owner = "foo"
```
  allows the user to run arbitrary queries on my DB;

* all values put into a query must be quoted & escaped.
  1. use a library function to escape
  2. use a function that builds the query
  ```javascript
  execute("SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id=?", id)
  ```
  3. use an ORM and let it write the SQL

## Cross-Site Scripting

* basic cause: displaying user-created content
  * e.g. user enters blog comments
* users' comment could be:
```html
<h1>Big Words!</h1>
```
  *but worse*
  ```html
  <script>alert("Hi!")</script>
  ```
  or more malicious logic

* can also occur in unexpected places
  * short inputs like name, email
  * in "javascript: " URLs

### Solutions

1. all input is "plain text"; escape the output.
  * e.g. we output `"&lt;script&gt;"`
  * every language/templating system can do this...
    but must remember to do it *every* time.
  * many templating systems escape by default.
  > If your templating engine does not escape them by default, it has a **bug**

2. allow user formatting, but not with HTML
  * HTML is too hard to sanitize
  * use a lightweight markup language like *markdown, textile, wikitext*
    * some allow **HTML** by default, like *markdown*

3. let the user enter `HTML`, but only some tags.
  * **very** hard to do correctly
  * use an `HTML` sanitizing library: *Bleach*, *HTML Purifier*
    * but none of these solve the "javascript: ..." URL problem
    * another case of needing to be careful with input.
    * should start with `http://` or `https://`

## Insufficient Authroization
  * problem: user requests a URL & you send the data  *without* checking if they should be able to see it.
  * it's easy to think URLs are hard to find
    * i.e. they're here because they clicked on the previous menu.
    * but it's easy to guess/find URLs
    * must check *every* request to ensure the user is *authorized*
      * extremely common problem in student code.
    * **don't confuse authentication with authorization**
      * **authentication**: who is this person?
      * **authorization**: is this person allowed?
    * easily forgotten for *secondary* content
      * e.g. images, AJAX requests, admin interfaces, ...
      * must be checked as carefully as any other request.
  * easy to check: start every controller/view with an authorization check.
  * be aware of smaller info leaks
    * e.g. part of a page that should only be visible to some users.

## Session Hijacking & Prediction
  * web apps that track user sessions
    * required for logging in.
    * tracked with a session cookie
  * what if someone can fake that token?

### Problems

#### Prediction
  * e.g. "user=ggbaker" is a very bad session token
  * another user can easily predict and take over my session
  * should be arbitrary & hard to guess

##### Solution
  * e.g. 256-bit random value
    * impossible to predict
    * very hard to guess & find one

#### Hijacking
  * happens if token can be found & copied
  * e.g.  over insecure wifi, proxy servers, network sniffing, ...
  * hard to prevent entirely

##### Solution
  * **HTTPS** is the real answer.

## Cross-Site Request Forgery

### Problem

> * user logs in to site **A**; has a session cookie
> * user visits site B which contains
> ```html
> <img src="https://a.com/delete?id=123" />
> ```
> * or B has a form like:
> ```html
> <form method="post" action="https://a.com/..." />
> ```
> * user makes a request to A with their session cookie.
> * **A takes action on their behalf**

### Prevention

* require a secret token for POST requests on site A

  ```html
  <form method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="csrf" value="3a7vkfm1" ... />
  ```
  and reject if that's not there
* no side effects in a GET
* most frameworks can do that, *but maybe off by default*

## Insecure Uploads/Static Content

### Problem
> users upload files, and they're served as static content

* no authorization checks
* user uploads runnable script file (causing server to run it)

### Solutions

* don't serve as static
  * write a controller/view to send the Content
  * can do auth check
* be very careful
  * with server config

## Insecure Data Storage
  * how is your data stored? Who has access?
    * obviously minimize the people who can access the DB server, backups, server, ...
  * take steps to limit access, even if an intruder gets access
  * important case: passwords
    * **never** store passwrods
    * store a hash of the password with
      * a good **and slow** hash function (hard to compute),
      * salted

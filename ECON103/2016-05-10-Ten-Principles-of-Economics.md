# Key Concepts

* Scarcity and Trade-off
* Opportunity Cost
* Marginal Reasoning
* Incentives
* Market and Government

## What Economics is All about

**Economics**: the study of how society manages its scarce resources.

> i.e..
> * how people decide what to buy/save with limited budget ,or how much to work with

**Scarcity**: the limited nature of society's resources

*Q:* The amount of Dandelion is limited in Vancouver, therefore Dandelion is scarce here?
**A:** Not really.

** A resource is scarce when its number is less than the level at which everyone wish to have**

Making decisions requires *trading off*.

## Principle 1: People Face Trade-Offs

All decisions involve trade-offs.

Examples:
* Going to a party the night before your exam leaves less time for studying.
* Having more money to buy stuff requires working longer hours

Society faces an important trade-off: **efficiency vs. equity**

**Efficiency**: getting the most from scarce resources
**Equity**: distributing the benefits of those resources fairely among the members of society

## Principle 2: The Cost of Something is what you Give up to Get it

**Opportunity cost**: whatever must be given up to obtain some item.

When economists refer to "cost", they mean "opportunity cost"

It is related to **Scarcity** and **Trade-off**.

## Principle 3: Rational People Think at the Margin

**Rational people**: Systematically and purposefully do the best they can to achieve their objectives, given the opportunities available.

*They make decisions by comparing marginal benefits and marginal costs*

**Marginal Benefit**: the increase in total benefit that arises from *an additional unit* of good

**Marginal Cost**: the increase in total cost from *an additional unit* of good

> **Note** Benefit is a subjective term. It might mean "value" or "happiness" for a consumer, but it means "revenue" for a producer

> See [Water-Diamond Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_value

The face that arional people consider the *marginal change*, instead of the total value implies that *rational people are forward-looking, not backward-looking*. They don't make a decision based on how much is the total net benefit from the past consumptions. Their decision is **based on how much a marginal net benefit** they will receive from an additional unit. They will keep using this metric until the marginal net benefit is negetive.

## Principle 4: People Response to Incentives

**Incentive**: something that induces a person to act

Examples:
* In response to higher gas prices, sales of hybrid cars rise.
* In response to higher cigarette taxes, the incidence of smoking falls.

## Principle 5: Trade can Make Everyone Better off

Trade allows specializations -> people can consume a greater variety of goods and services at lower cost

## Principle 6: Markets are Usually a Good Way to Organize Economic Activity

**Market Economy**: an economy that allocates resources through the *decentralized decisions* of many firms and households as they interact in order to exchange goods or services. It is an antonym to **centrally planned economy**, in which the decisions are made by a central planner.

* The price adjusts itself to guide buyers and sellers to reach the **optimal outcome**.
* **Take away**: When the price can't freely adjust itself, the outcome is sub-obtimal

## Principle 7: Governments can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes

Unfortunately, market leads to the optimal outcome only under some assumptions are satisfied.

When some of those assumptions are not satisfied, government may help improve the market outcomes. Such as...

1. Government can enforce property rights
  * **Property Rights**: The ability of an individual to own and exercise control over scarce resources.
2. Government intervention may improve outcomes under the context of *market failure* (the market fails to allocate society's resources Efficiency)
  1. **Externalities**: the impact of one person's actions on the well-being of a bystander (*pollution*)
  2. **Market power**: the ability of a single person to have a substantial influence on he market prices
  3. **Asymmetric information**: A situation in which a party has more information about the good/services than the other
  4. **Public Goods**: It's non-excludable (cannot prevent anyone from using it) -> free riding problem -> impossible to be produced by a private provider.

### (Look for the last 3 principles in the textbook)

2. Individuals face trade-offs.
3. Opportunity cost is whatever must be given up to obtain some item.
